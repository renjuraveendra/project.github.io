            <p>We are experts in data entry from forms, including surveys, questionnaires, applications, and every type
              of form. Because of how common this type of data entry is, we have developed custom solutions, aided by
              software, to make the process faster, easier, and more reliable. Forms processing produces valuable data
              and insights, which require a big data approach to get the full value the data can bring to your business.
              Our forms processing data entry technology is designed not only for efficiency and reliability of the data
              entry process itself but also to present the data in customizable and easily understandable ways.

            <p> Bookkeeping is one of the core business functions, which most often requires ongoing data entry support
              for processing data from paper-based and third-party sources, to integrate it into a unified data
              management system. This is because bookkeeping deals with compliance requirements as well as integration
              requirements. Our data entry, specialized for bookkeeping, includes:<br>
              • Transaction processing.<br>
              • Order processing.<br>

            <p> Document formatting refers to the way a document is laid out on the page-the way it looks and is
              visually organized and it addresses things like font selection, font size and presentation (like bold or
              italics), spacing, margins, alignment, columns, indentation, and lists.
              Alteration is defined as any change to a document which gives it a different effect from that it
              originally possessed. alterations include erasures, charring, indented writing, additional markings, as
              well as obliterations, while obliterations are the overwriting of text with another substance.

            <p> Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has revolutionized the data entry industry over the past few years.
              Our company is proud to be a leader in devising and implementing best practices for how companies
              integrate this powerful technology into their data entry operations. Smart use of OCR for data entry
              projects is all about our motto of smart people and smart machines working together. We customize our
              solutions based on client specifications to understand how best to put the technology to use for your
              project. Our solutions are designed to extract the benefits of OCR but to mitigate the risk inherent with
              machine processing by utilizing human oversight and quality assurance. This is an art, which when handled
              right allows our clients to cut costs and reduce project work time considerably. We integrate human data
              entry typists with OCR through custom project management solutions designed specifically for data entry,
              and easily configured to just about any project specification.

            <p> We all enjoy the benefits of using a computer word processor to type out our documents, rather than
              having to struggle with a pen and paper. There are a lot of great advantages, such as the ability to edit
              and share our work easily. But there are also many times when a lot of people prefer to use a good
              oldfashioned pen and paper to write down their ideas. At Dexa Mexon, we are proud to offer low-cost, fast,
              efficient, and highly accurate handwritten content typing services for every need. We are able to provide
              a better value than other companies because we are smarter at how we go about planning our typing
              projects. We use the best technology, including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and also other custom
              project management systems, and best practices for producing the best results at the lowest possible cost.

            <p> PDF (Portable Document Form t) is a way of formatting documents that allows them to be viewed and
              printed on different eystems without changing the layout. PDF is the preferred way of distributing
              documents or publishing them on the web. It has become the most widely used format for legal, technical,
              and reference documents and for market research material. Pape documentsv digital files, microfiche, and
              microfil can all be scanned, then converted to PDF format. PDF documents can be easily retrieved using the
              free Adobe Reader software, and its search facility makes it simple to search entire directories for data.
              Text file conversion into PDF formats is therefore very useful for marketing research services. PDF
              scanning and PDF Conversion services are used for financial documentation, technical documentation, HR
              applications, and Research material.

            <p> We understand that your data needs to be correct and reliable. This is why data cleansing is built into

              specifically to mitigate those risks. A large part of what makes our data entry solutions so reliable and
              our accuracy levels so high is that we understand the fine art of building data cleansing protocols into
              our solutions. Quality assurance and cleansing procedures should be executed at the perfect moment during
              the process, to ensure that errors are caught early on. This is why our data cleansing solutions are
              designed to be customizable and responsive.

            <p> Web design and development is an umbrella term that describes the process of creating a website. As the
              name suggests, it involves two major skill sets: web design and web development. Web design determines the
              look and feeling of a website, while web development determines how it functions. Using coding languages
              like HTML, CSS, and Javascript to implement that design is called front-end developmen These languages
              make it possible for users to interact with buttons, images, text, contact forms, and avigation menus.
